- 👋 Hi, I’m @harshitjuneja
- 👀 I’m interested in Learning patterns from data and using them to help organizations find opportunities to make money/make their systems better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about models that can estimate the true nature of data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would build on our skills or those that leverage existing skills to build something valuable to everyone.
